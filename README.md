# Online-Delivery-System

This project is a single page web app with full search functionality. It provides three responses
when any query is fed into the search bar. Worked on this to try and cement my understanding on javasript.

My main focus was on crypto assets and alternative coins and there are a few things I need to highlight here. For the search funtionality to yield results, you MUST key in a name of any cryptocurrency or any other alt coins and this is case sensitive.Here's an example of what I mean:

      key in Polkadot and you are likely to receive an error "No results found"
      now try the same search term but with all letters lower case

Searching for #Polkadot and #polkadot will yield different results and this applies to all other assets. For a term that matches data in the API, the output will display the asset symbol, price and the total amount in supply.
